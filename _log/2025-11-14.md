Zeteo scoops on a "bonkers" national security strategy draft.

>There is so much about the draft papers that have caused some who’ve seen it to privately complain that it **reads like openly fascist European rantings from the first half of the 20th century.**

>...highly unusual in its specificities & grievance peddling...

>One notable NSS was produced by the George W. Bush administration post-9/11; the document highlighted a willingness for preemptive war and **served as a quiet prelude to the disasters and international horrors that would soon follow.**
