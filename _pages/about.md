This is my GitHub page, based on Academic Pages template.[^template] Will be containing my archives at some point. Maybe.

For my bloggings in English, see [jmkorhonen.net](https://jmkorhonen.net/). My Finnish blog is at [jmkorhonen.fi](https://jmkorhonen.fi/).


[^template]: This website is powered by the [Academic Pages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and hosted on GitHub pages. This template was forked from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) created by Michael Rose, and then extended.
