My name is Janne and this is my GitHub public notebook and archive for things I’ve thought about at some point. I’ve been curious about many things over the years, and still believe that Robert A. Heinlein got something right here:

>*“A human being should be able to change a diaper, plan an invasion, butcher a hog, conn a ship, design a building, write a sonnet, balance accounts, build a wall, set a bone, comfort the dying, take orders, give orders, cooperate, act alone, solve equations, analyze a new problem, pitch manure, program a computer, cook a tasty meal, fight efficiently, die gallantly.* **Specialization is for insects.**”
>
>― Robert A. Heinlein, “Time Enough for Love”

Right now the main thing here are the notes and examples for [Project DYNAMO](https://jmkorhonen.github.io/projects/DYNAMO/), my 2025-2028 job to develop agent-based and other modelling tools for Circular Economy transition and market research.

For other stuff, see [Projects](https://jmkorhonen.github.io/projects/).

I will be migrating my archives here, mostly at [Blog posts](https://jmkorhonen.github.io/year-archive/), at some point. Maybe.

For my blog in English, see [jmkorhonen.net](https://jmkorhonen.net/). 

My Finnish blog is at [jmkorhonen.fi](https://jmkorhonen.fi/).
