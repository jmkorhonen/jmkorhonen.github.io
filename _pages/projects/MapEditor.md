MapEditor is a very simple tool I created to input location-based data I could use in my [DYNAMO](https://jmkorhonen.github.io/projects/DYNAMO/) project. Coded with JavaScript, it can be customized easily for project-specific purposes. Feel free to use and improve.

The latest version is [MapEditor 0.4.0, available here.](https://github.com/jmkorhonen/jmkorhonen/blob/main/MapEditor/MapEditor_0.4.0.html)
