MapEditor is a very simple browser-based JavaScript tool I created to input location-based data I could use in my [DYNAMO](https://jmkorhonen.github.io/projects/DYNAMO/) project. Coded with JavaScript, it can be customized easily for project-specific purposes. Feel free to use and improve.

The latest version is [MapEditor 0.4.0, available here.](https://github.com/jmkorhonen/jmkorhonen/blob/main/MapEditor/MapEditor_0.4.0.html)

You can simply download this file or copy-paste it and save as a .html file.
Click on the file, and it should open in browser.
You can then plop pins on the map, and click them to input values to different fields.
Data can be exported in Excel or GeoJSON formats. 
All fields and functionalities are simple to modify for project-specific needs.
MapEditor uses Leaflet and OpenStreetMap data.
